### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior data scientist at Microsoft Research who focuses on algorithmic fairness and responsible AI. A key part of my role is developing the [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn) Python package. Previously, I was at J.P. Morgan Chase where I worked on explainable AI for finance.
