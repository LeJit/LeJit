### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior data scientist at Spotify where I work on the Algorithmic Impact team under Trust & Safety. I was a senior data scientist at Microsoft Research where I worked on the [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn) Python package and understanding the challenges data scientists face when incorporating fairness and responsible AI practices in their workflow. Before that, I was at J.P. Morgan Chase where I worked on explainable AI for finance.
